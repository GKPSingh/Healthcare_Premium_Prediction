# Healthcare_Premium_Prediction - Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting annual health insurance premiums using a large real-world dataset of nearly 50,000 policyholders.
The objective is to understand the key drivers of premium pricing and build accurate, business-ready predictive models using both statistical and machine learning approaches.
The project follows a complete end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, multicollinearity handling, model training, and error analysis.
